<h1>Confessions</h1>
<p>Welcome to Confessions</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Confessions is an application designed by Cody Pellom. A simple, therapeutic 
    concept based on the ancient practice of "confession". Confessions is completely
    anonymous; each user ID is a number randomly generated by the Javascript function,
    "Math.random()", and is set to generate a random integer between 1 and 10,000. 
    <br>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        The confessions can take any form the user would like, from poetry to comedy, to 
        artisitc prose. All we ask is no judgment of other members using Confessions.
